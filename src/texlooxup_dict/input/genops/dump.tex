\cts dump {}
\explain
This command, which must not appear inside a group, dumps the
contents of \TeX's memory
to a ^{format file} (\xref{format file}).
By using ^|virtex|, a special ``virgin'' form of \TeX,
you can then reload the format file at high speed and 
continue in the same state that \TeX\ was in at the time of the dump.
|\dump| also ends the run.  Since |\dump| can only be used
in ^|initex|, not in production forms of \TeX, it is only useful
to people who are installing \TeX.
