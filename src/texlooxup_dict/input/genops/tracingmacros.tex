If this parameter is $1$ or greater,
\TeX\ will record in the log file the expansion and arguments
of every macro that it executes.
^^{macros//tracing}
If |\tracingmacros| is $2$ or greater,
\TeX\ will record, in addition,
every expansion of a \minref{token} list such as
|\output| or |\everycr|.
If ^|\tracingonline| is greater than zero, this information will also appear
at your terminal.
