\cts special {\rqbraces{\<token list>}}
\explain
This command tells \TeX\ to 
write \<token list> directly to the \dvifile\ when it next
ships out a page.
A typical use of |\special| would be to tell the device driver to incorporate
the contents of a named graphics file into the output page.
^^{device drivers//instructions from \b\tt\\special\e}
The |\special| command produces a whatsit that associates
\<token list> with a particular position on the page, namely,
the position that a zero-size box would have had if such a box
had appeared instead of the |\special| command.
Any use you might make of |\special| depends strictly on
the ^{device drivers} that you have available.
\example
\special{graphic expic} 
% Display the graphics file `expic' here.
