\cts closeout {\<number>}
\explain
^^{output streams//closing}
This command tells \TeX\ to close the \minref{output stream} numbered
\<number>. i.e.,
end the association between the output stream and its file.
The output stream with this number then becomes available for use with a
different file.
You should close an output stream once you're finished using its file.

A |\closeout| generates a whatsit that becomes part of a box.
The |\closeout| does not take effect until \TeX\ ships out that box
to the \dvifile,
unless you've preceded the |\closeout| with ^|\immediate|.
