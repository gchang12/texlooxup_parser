\cts closein {\<number>}
\explain
This command tells \TeX\ to close the \minref{input stream} numbered
\<number>, i.e.,
end the association between the input stream and its file.
The input stream with this number then becomes available for use with a
different file.
You should close an input stream once you're finished using its file.
