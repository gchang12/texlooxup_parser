\explain
These commands are equivalent to tests that are always true or always
false.  The main use of these commands is in defining macros that keep
track of the result of a test.
\example
\def\isbigger{\let\bigger=\iftrue}
\def\isnotbigger{\let\bigger=\iffalse}
% These \let's MUST be buried in macros!!  If they aren't,
% TeX erroneously tries to match them with \fi.
\def\test#1#2{\ifnum #1>#2 \isbigger\else\isnotbigger\fi}
\test{3}{6}
\bigger$3>6$\else$3\le6$\fi
|
\produces
\def\isbigger{\let\bigger=\iftrue}
\def\isnotbigger{\let\bigger=\iffalse}
% These \let's MUST be buried in macros!
% If they aren't, TeX erroneously tries to match them with \fi
\def\test#1#2{\ifnum #1>#2 \isbigger\else\isnotbigger\fi}
\test{3}{6}
\bigger$3>6$\else$3\le6$\fi
