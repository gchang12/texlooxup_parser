\explain
^^{numbers//comparing}
This command tests if \<number$_1$> and \<number$_2$>
satisfy \<relation>, which must be either `|<|', `|=|', or `|>|'.
The numbers can be constants such as |127|, count registers such as
|\pageno| or |\count22|, or numerical parameters such as |\hbadness|.
Before performing the test, \TeX\ expands tokens following the |\ifnum|
until it obtains a sequence of tokens having
the form \<number$_1$> \<relation> \<number$_2$>, followed by a token
that can't be part of \<number$_2$>.
\example
\count255 = 19 \ifnum \count255 > 12 true\else false\fi
|
\produces
\count255 = 19 \ifnum \count255 > 12 true\else false\fi
