\cts tracingcommands {\param{number}}
\explain
If this parameter is $1$ or greater,
\TeX\ will record in the log file most commands that it executes.
If ^|\tracingonline| is greater than zero, this information will also appear
at your terminal.
Typesetting the first character of a word counts as a command,
but (for the purposes of the trace only) 
the actions of typesetting the subsequent characters
and any punctuation following them
do not count as commands.
If |\tracingcommands| is $2$ or greater,
\TeX\ will also record commands that are expanded
rather than executed, e.g., conditional tests and their outcomes.
\example
\tracingcommands = 1 If $x+y>0$ we quit.\par
On the other hand, \tracingcommands = 0
