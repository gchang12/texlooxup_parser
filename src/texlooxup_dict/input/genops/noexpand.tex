\cts noexpand {\<token>}
\explain
This command tells \TeX\ to 
suppress expansion of \<token> if \<token> is a 
\minref{control sequence} that can be expanded.
If \<token> can't be expanded, e.g., it's a letter,
\TeX\ acts as though the |\noexpand| wasn't there
and processes \<token> normally.
In other words the expansion of `|\noexpand|\<token>'
is simply \<token> no matter what \<token> happens to be.
\example
\def\bunny{rabbit}
\edef\magic{Pull the \noexpand\bunny\ out of the hat!! }
% Without \noexpand, \bunny would always be replaced
% by `rabbit'
\let\oldbunny=\bunny \def\bunny{lagomorph} \magic
\let\bunny=\oldbunny \magic
|
\produces
\def\bunny{rabbit}
\edef\magic{Pull the \noexpand\bunny\ out of the hat! }
% Without \noexpand, \bunny would always be replaced
% by `rabbit'
\let\oldbunny=\bunny \def\bunny{lagomorph} \magic
\let\bunny=\oldbunny \magic
