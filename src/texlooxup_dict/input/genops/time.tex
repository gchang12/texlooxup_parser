^^{time of day}
\cts time {\param{number}}
\explain
\TeX\ sets this parameter to the 
number of minutes that have elapsed since midnight (of the current day).
At noon, for instance, |\time| is $720$.
This command and the next three make use of the time and date as
recorded in your computer.
\TeX\ retrieves them just once, at the beginning of your run, so |\time|
at the end of the run always has the same value as |\time| at the
beginning of the run (unless you've explicitly changed it).
