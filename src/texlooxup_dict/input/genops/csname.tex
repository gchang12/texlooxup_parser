\cts csname {\<token list> {\bt \\endcsname}}
\xrdef{\endcsname}
\explain
This command produces a control sequence from \<token list>.
It provides a way of synthesizing control sequences,
including ones that you can't normally write.
\<token list> can itself include control sequences; it is expanded
in the same way as the replacement text of an |\edef| definition (\xref\edef).
If the final expansion
yields anything that isn't a character, \TeX\ will complain.
|\csname| goes from a list of tokens to a control sequence;
you can go the other way with ^|\string| \ctsref\string.
\example
\def\capTe{Te}
This book purports to be about \csname\capTe X\endcsname.
