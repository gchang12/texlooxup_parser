\cts pausing {\param{number}}
\explain
If this parameter is greater than zero, \TeX\ will pause
at each line of input to give you an opportunity to 
replace it with a different line.  If you type in a replacement,
\TeX\ will use that line instead of the original one; if you respond
with \asciichar{return}, \TeX\ will use the original line.

Setting |\pausing| to $1$ can be useful as a way of patching a document as 
\TeX\ is processing it.  For example,
you can use this facility to insert ^|\show| commands (see below).
