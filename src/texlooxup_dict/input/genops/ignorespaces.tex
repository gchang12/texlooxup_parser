\explain
This command tells \TeX\ to read and expand tokens until it finds one that
is not a space \minref{token}, ignoring any space tokens
that it finds on the way.
|\ignorespaces| is often useful at the end of a \minref{macro} as a way
of making the macro insensitive to any spaces or ends of line
that might follow calls on it.
(An empty line after |\ignorespaces| still produces a |\par| token,
however.)
