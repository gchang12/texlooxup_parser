\cts globaldefs {\param{number}}
\explain
This parameter controls whether or not \TeX\ takes definitions
and other assignments to be 
\minref{global}:
\ulist
\li If |\globaldefs| is zero (as it is by default), a definition is global
if and only if it is preceded by |\global| either explicitly or implicitly.
(The ^|\gdef| and ^|\xdef| commands (\xref\gdef) have an implicit
|\global| prefix).
\li If |\globaldefs| is greater than zero, all assignments and
definitions are implicitly prefixed by ^|\global|.
\li If |\globaldefs| is less than zero, all ^|\global| prefixes are ignored.
