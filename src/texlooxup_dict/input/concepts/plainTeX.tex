\concept {\plainTeX}

\defterm{\PlainTeX} is the form of \TeX\ described in this
book and in \texbook.  \PlainTeX\ is part of the standard \TeX\
system, so documents that use only the facilities of \plainTeX\ can
usually be transferred from one installation to another without
difficulty.

\PlainTeX\ consists of the \refterm{primitive} commands together with a
large collection of macros and
other definitions.  These additional definitions are given in
\knuth{Appendix~B}.  They should also be in the file |plain.tex|
somewhere in your computer system.
