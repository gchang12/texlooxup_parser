\concept muglue

\defterm{Muglue} is a kind of \refterm{glue} that you can use only in math
formulas.  It is measured in ^|mu| (\refterm{mathematical
units:mathematical unit}).
^^{mathematical units}^^{glue//mathematical}
One |mu| is equal to \frac1/{18} em, where
the size of an em is taken from \refterm{family} 2 of the math fonts.
\TeX\ automatically adjusts the size of muglue according to the context.
For instance, a glue size of |2mu| is normally smaller within a
subscript than it is within ordinary text.  
You must use the ^|\mskip| command to produce muglue.
For example, `|\mskip 4mu plus 5mu|' produces mathematical glue with
natural space of four |mu| and \refterm{stretch} of five |mu|.
