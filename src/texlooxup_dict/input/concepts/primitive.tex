\concept {primitive}

A \defterm{primitive} \refterm{command} is one whose definition is built
into the \TeX\ computer program.  In contrast, a command that is not
primitive is defined by a \refterm{macro} or some other form of
definition written in \TeX\ itself.  The commands in \refterm{\plainTeX}
consist of the primitive commands together with
other commands defined in terms of the
primitive ones.
