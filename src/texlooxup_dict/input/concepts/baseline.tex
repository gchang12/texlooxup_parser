\concept baseline

The \defterm{baseline} of a \refterm{box} is an imaginary line that runs
across the box.
^^{boxes//baselines of}
When \TeX\ is
assembling the boxes of a \refterm{horizontal list} into a larger box,
it lines up the boxes in the list so that their baselines coincide.
As an analogy, think of writing on a pad of ruled paper.  Each letter 
that you write has
an implicit baseline.
In order to line up the letters horizontally,
you place them on the pad so that their baselines
agree with the light guidelines that are printed on the pad.

A box can and often does extend below its baseline.
For instance, the letter `g' extends below the baseline of its box because
it has a descender (the bottom loop of the `g').
