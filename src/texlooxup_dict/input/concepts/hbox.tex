\concept hbox

An \defterm{hbox} (horizontal box) is a \refterm{box} that \TeX\
constructs by placing the items of a \refterm{horizontal list} one after
another, left to right.
^^{horizontal lists//hboxes formed from}
An hbox, taken as a unit, is neither
inherently horizontal nor inherently vertical, i.e., it can appear as an
item of either a horizontal list or a \refterm{vertical list}.  You can
construct an hbox with the |\hbox| command \ctsref{\hbox}.
