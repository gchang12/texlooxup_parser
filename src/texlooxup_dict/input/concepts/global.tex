\concept global

A \defterm{global} definition is effective 
until the end of the
document or until it is overridden by another definition,
even when it occurs within a \refterm{group}.  
Thus a global definition is unaffected by group boundaries.
You can make any definition global by prefixing it with the |\global|
command \ctsref{\global} unless ^|\globaldefs| \ctsref\globaldefs{}
is negative.
^^|\global|

There's a special way of making a \refterm{macro} definition global.
^^{macros//global}
Normally you define a macro using either the |\def| command
or the |\edef| command \ctsref{\edef}.
^^|\edef//making global|
^^|\def//making global|
If you use |\gdef| or |\xdef|
instead of |\def| and |\edef| respectively, the macro definition will
be global.  That is, `^|\gdef|' is equivalent to `|\global\def|' and
`^|\xdef|' is equivalent to `|\global\edef|'.
