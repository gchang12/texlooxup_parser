\concept {control word} 

A \defterm{control word} is a \refterm{control sequence} that consists
of an \refterm{escape character} followed by one or more
letters.\footnote{A ``letter'' here has the strict meaning of a
character with category code $11$.}
\TeX\
ignores any spaces or ends-of-line that follow a control word, except to
note that they end the control word.
