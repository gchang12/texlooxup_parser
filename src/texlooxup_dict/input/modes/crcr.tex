\cts crcr {}
\explain
This command behaves just like ^|\cr|, except that \TeX\ ignores it if
it comes immediately after a |\cr| or a ^|\noalign|.
Its main application is as a safety measure to avoid a misleading error
message caused by a \minref{macro} that expects an argument ending in |\cr|.
If you put |\crcr| after the `|#|$n$' that denotes such an argument
in the macro's definition, the
macro will work properly whether or not the argument ends with |\cr|.
