^^{fill}
These commands respectively fill the enclosing horizontal space with 
a row of dots on the baseline and with
a horizontal line on the baseline.
It's usually a good idea to leave a space between 
|\dotfill| or |\hrulefill|
and any text that precedes or follows it (see the example below).
\example
\hbox to 3in{Start {\dotfill} Finish}
\hbox to 3in{Swedish {\hrulefill} Finnish}
