\cts everycr {\param{token list}}
\explain
\TeX\ expands \<token list> whenever it executes
a |\cr|---at the end of every preamble,
at the end of every row of a horizontal alignment,
and at the end of every column of a vertical alignment.
The |\everycr| commands are expanded just after the |\cr|.
Thus you can cause \TeX\ to
execute certain commands at the end of a preamble, row, or column by
assigning a list of those commands to |\everycr|.

The |\everycr| tokens shouldn't include any commands other than |\no!-align|.
That's because 
the |\everycr| tokens will reappear after the last
|\cr| of the alignment. A command other than
|\noalign| will then make \TeX\ think that it's starting a new
row or column.
\TeX\ will complain about a missing |\cr|, insert
a |\cr|, insert the |\everycr| tokens again, and repeat these actions
indefinitely. 
\example
\everycr={\noalign{\smallskip\hrule\smallskip}}
\halign{#\tabskip = 11pt&\hfil#\hfil&\hfil#\hfil
      \tabskip = 0pt\cr
   $1$&one&first\cr
   $2$&two&second\cr
   $3$&three&third\cr}
