\bix^^{leaders}
\easy\cts leaders {\<box or rule> \<skip command>}
\cts cleaders {\<box or rule> \<skip command>}
\cts xleaders {\<box or rule> \<skip command>}
\explain
These commands produce \minref{leaders}, i.e., they fill a 
horizontal or vertical space with
copies of a pattern \seeconcept{leaders}.
The \<box> or \<rule> specifies a leader,
i.e., a single copy of the pattern,
while the \<skip command> specifies a 
window to be filled with a
row or a column of the leaders.
The pattern is repeated as many times as will fit into the window.
If \<skip command> is a horizontal skip, the window 
contains a row of leaders and \TeX\ must be in a horizontal mode;
if \<skip command> is a vertical skip, the window
contains a column of leaders and \TeX\ must be in a vertical mode.

The commands differ in how they arrange the repeated pattern in the space
and where they put any leftover space:

\ulist\compact
\li For |\leaders|, \TeX\ aligns a row of leaders with the left end of
the innermost \minref{box} $B$ that is to contain the result of the
|\leaders| command.
It aligns a column of leaders with the top of $B$.
Those leaders that fall entirely within the window are retained.
Any leftover space at the top and bottom of the window is left empty.
\li For |\cleaders|, the leaders are centered within the window.
\li For |\xleaders| the pattern is uniformly distributed throughout the window.
If the leftover space is $l$ and the leader is repeated  $n$ times,
\TeX\ puts space of width or height $l/(n+1)$ between adjacent leaders and
at the two ends (left and right or top and bottom) of the leaders.
