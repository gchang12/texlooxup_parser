\explain
These commands indicate increasingly desirable places for \TeX\ to
break a page.  They also cause \TeX\ to 
insert a ^|\smallskip|, ^|\medskip|, or
^|\bigskip| (\xref \smallskip) if the page break doesn't actually
happen.  \TeX\ suppresses this skip if it occurs just after an
equal or larger skip.
