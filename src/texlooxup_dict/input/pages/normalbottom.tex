\explain
Normally \TeX\ tries hard to ensure that all pages have the same depth,
i.e., that their bottom margins are equal.
The |\raggedbottom| command tells \TeX\ to
allow some variability among the bottom margins on different pages.
It's often appropriate to use |\raggedbottom| when you have material that
contains large blocks of material that should not be split across pages.
The |\normalbottom| command cancels the effect of |\raggedbottom|.
