These commands force a page break at the current position
and end the current paragraph.
If you don't precede them with |\vfil| (\xref \vfil),
^^|\vfil//needed with {\tt\\eject}|
\TeX\ will try to stretch out the page contents
(and will probably complain about an underfull vbox).
The |\supereject| command, in addition,
instructs the \plainTeX\ output routine to
force out any leftover insertions,
^^{insertions//forced out by \b\tt\\supereject\e}
such as long footnotes,
so that they are produced before any more input
is processed. Thus |\supereject| is a good command to use at the end of each
chapter or other major unit of your document.
