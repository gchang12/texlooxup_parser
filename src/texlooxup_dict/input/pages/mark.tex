\explain
\bix^^{marks}
This command causes \TeX\ to append a mark
containing \<mark text>
to whatever list it is currently constructing.
Generally you shouldn't use |\mark| within an
``inner'' construct such as a math formula or a \minref{box}
you've built with an |\hbox|, |\vbox|, or |\vtop| command, because
\TeX\ won't see the mark when it's constructing the main box of the page.  But
if you use |\mark| in ordinary horizontal \minref{mode}
or directly in an hbox that's part of the main vertical list,
the mark migrates out
to the main \minref{vertical list}.
See \knuth{pages~259--260} for examples showing how |\mark| can be used.
