^^{page origin}
\idxsee{origin}{page origin}
\explain
\TeX\ normally takes the ``origin'' of a page, that is, the point where
it starts printing, as being one inch down from the top of the page and one 
inch to the right of the left end of the page.\footnote{
\TeX\ itself is indifferent to where the origin of the page is,
but this information has to be built into the device drivers
^^{device drivers//page origin known to}
that convert \dvifile s into printable form so that different devices
will yield the same results.}
The values of |\hoffset| and
|\voffset| give the horizontal and vertical offset of the actual origin
from this point.  Thus if |\hoffset| and |\voffset| are both
zero, \TeX\ uses its normal origin.
\example
\hoffset = -.3in
   % Start printing .7 inches from left edge of paper.
\voffset = 1in
   % Start printing 2 inches from top edge of paper.
