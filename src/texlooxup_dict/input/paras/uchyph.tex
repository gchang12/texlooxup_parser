\cts uchyph {\param{number}}
\explain
A positive value of |\uchyph| (uppercase hyphenation)
permits hyphenation of words, such as proper names,
that start with a capital letter.
A zero or negative
value inhibits such hyphenation.  \PlainTeX\ sets |\uchyph| to $1$,
so \TeX\  normally tries to hyphenate words that start with a capital letter.
