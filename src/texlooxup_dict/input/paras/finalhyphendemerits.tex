\minrefs{line break}
{\tighten
This parameter specifies additional \minref{demerits} that \TeX\
attaches to a breakpoint that causes 
the next to last line of a paragraph to end with a hyphen.
Such a hyphen is generally considered to be unaesthetic
because of the possible blank space from a short last line beneath it.
Increasing the value of this parameter has the effect of discouraging
\TeX\ from ending the next to the last line with a hyphen.
Demerits are in units of \minref{badness} squared, so
you need to assign a rather large value to this parameter (in the
thousands) for it to have any effect.
\PlainTeX\ sets |\finalhyphendemerits| to $5000$.
