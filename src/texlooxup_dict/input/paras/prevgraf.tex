\cts prevgraf {\param{number}}
\explain
In horizontal mode, this parameter specifies the 
number of lines in the paragraph so far; in vertical mode,
it specifies the number of lines in the previous paragraph.
\TeX\ only sets |\prevgraf| after it has finished breaking some text into
lines, i.e., at a math display or at the end of a paragraph.
See \knuth{page~103} for more details about it.
