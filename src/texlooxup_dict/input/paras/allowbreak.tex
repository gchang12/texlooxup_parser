\ctspecial allowbreak {} \xrdef{hallowbreak}
\explain
This command tells \TeX\ to 
allow a line break where one could not ordinarily occur.
It's most often useful within a math formula, since \TeX\
is reluctant to break lines there.  ^^{line breaks//in math formulas}
|\allowbreak| can also be used in vertical mode.
\example
Under most circumstances we can state with some confidence
that $2+2\allowbreak=4$, but skeptics may disagree.
\par For such moronic automata, it is not difficult to
analyze the input/\allowbreak output behavior in the limit.
