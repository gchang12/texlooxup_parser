\cts textindent {\<argument>}
\explain
^^{indentation}
This command tells \TeX\ to start a paragraph and indent it by
|\par!-indent|,
as usual.
\TeX\ then right-justifies \<argument> within the indentation
and
follows it with an en space (half an em).
\PlainTeX\ uses this command to typeset footnotes (\xref\footnote)
^^{footnotes//using \b\tt\\textindent\e\ with}
and items in lists (see |\item|, \xref\item).

\example
\parindent = 20pt \textindent{\raise 1pt\hbox{$\bullet$}}%
You are allowed to use bullets in \TeX\ even if
you don't join the militia, and many peace-loving
typographers do so.
