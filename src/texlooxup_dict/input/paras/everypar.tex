\cts everypar {\param{token list}}
\explain
\TeX\ performs the commands in \<token list> whenever it
enters horizontal mode, e.g., when it starts a paragraph.
By default |\everypar| is empty, but you can 
take extra actions at the start of every paragraph by putting
the commands for those actions into a token list
and assigning that token list to |\everypar|.

\example
\everypar = {$\Longrightarrow$\enspace}
Now pay attention!!\par
I said, ``Pay attention!!''.\par
I'll say it again!! Pay attention!!
|
\produces
\everypar = {$\Longrightarrow$\enspace}
Now pay attention!\par
I said, ``Pay attention!''.\par
I'll say it again! Pay attention!
