This command ``proclaims'' a theorem, lemma, hypothesis, etc.
It sets \<argument> in boldface type and the following paragraph in
italics.  \<arg\-u\-ment> must be followed by a period and a space token,
which serve
to set off \<argument> from \<general text>.
\<general text> consists of the text up to the next paragraph
boundary.  You can include multiple paragraphs by using |\endgraf|
instead of a blank line or |\par|.
