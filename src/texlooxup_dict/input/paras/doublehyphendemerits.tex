\cts doublehyphendemerits {\param{number}}
\explain
\minrefs{line break}
{\tighten
This parameter specifies additional \minref{demerits} that \TeX\
attaches to a breakpoint when that breakpoint leads to
two consecutive lines that end in a hyphen.
Increasing the value of this parameter has the effect of discouraging
\TeX\ from hyphenating two lines in a row.
Demerits are in units of \minref{badness} squared, so
you need to assign a rather large value to this parameter (in the
thousands) for it to have any effect.
\PlainTeX\ sets |\doublehyphendemerits| to $10000$.
