\explain
This command indents the second and subsequent lines of a paragraph
by |\parindent|, the paragraph ^{indentation}
(\xref{\parindent}).
Since the first line is already indented by |\parindent|
(unless you've cancelled the indentation with |\noindent|), the
entire paragraph appears to be indented by |\parindent|.

\example
\parindent=24pt \hang  ``I said you {\it looked} like an
egg, Sir,'' Alice gently explained to Humpty Dumpty. ``And
some eggs are very pretty, you know,'' she added.
