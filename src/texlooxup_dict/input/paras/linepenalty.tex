\cts linepenalty {\param{number}}
\explain
\minrefs{line break}
This parameter specifies the \minref{penalty} that \TeX\ assesses for each line
break when it is breaking a paragraph into lines.
The penalty is independent of where the line break occurs.
Increasing the value
of this parameter causes \TeX\ to try harder to set a paragraph with a 
minimum number of lines, even at the cost of other aesthetic considerations
such as avoiding overly tight interword spacing.
Demerits are in units of \minref{badness} squared, so
you need to assign a rather large value to this parameter (in the
thousands) for it to have any effect.
\PlainTeX\ sets |\linepenalty| to $10$.
