\explain
These commands tell \TeX\ to treat the construct that follows as belonging
to a particular ^{class} (see \knuth{page~154} for the definition
of the classes).  They are listed here in the order of the class numbers,
from $0$ to $6$.  Their primary 
effect is to adjust the spacing around the construct
to be whatever it is for the specified class.

\example
$\mathop{\rm minmax}\limits_{t \in A \cup B}\,t$
% By treating minmax as a math operator, we can get TeX to
% put something underneath it.

\produces
$\mathop{\rm minmax}\limits_{t \in A \cup B}\,t$
