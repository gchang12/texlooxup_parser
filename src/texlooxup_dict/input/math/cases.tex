^^{combinations, notation for}
This command produces the mathematical form that denotes a choice among
several cases.
Each case has two parts, separated by `|&|'.
\TeX\ treats the first part as a math formula
and the second part as ordinary text.  Each
case must be followed by |\cr|.

\example
$$g(x,y) = \cases{f(x,y),&if $x<y$\cr
                  f(y,x),&if $x>y$\cr
                  0,&otherwise.\cr}$$
