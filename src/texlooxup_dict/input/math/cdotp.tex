\bix^^{punctuation in math formulas}
\cts cdotp {}
\cts ldotp {}
\explain
These two commands respectively produce a centered dot and a dot
positioned on the \minref{baseline}.  They are valid only in math
\minref{mode}.  \TeX\ treats them as punctuation, putting no extra space in
front of them but a little extra space after them.
In contrast, \TeX\ puts an equal amount of space on both sides
of a centered dot generated by the ^|\cdot| command (\xref \cdot).
\example
$x \cdotp y \quad x \ldotp y \quad x \cdot y$

\produces
$x \cdotp y \quad x \ldotp y \quad x \cdot y$
