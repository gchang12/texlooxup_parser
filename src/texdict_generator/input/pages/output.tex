\cts output {\param{token list}}
\explain
This parameter contains the current \minref{output routine}, i.e., 
the token list that \TeX\ expands when it finds a page break.
\TeX\ puts the page into ^|\box255|, so |\output| is responsible
for doing something with |\box255|---either shipping it out or
putting it somewhere else.
The output routine is also responsible for attaching things such as
headers and footers.
