^^{marks//for split lists}
These commands expand to the ^{mark text} generated by an earlier
^|\mark| command that produced an item in the item list of a vbox $V$.
The mark text has the form of a token list.
When \TeX\ 
splits $V$ in response to a ^|\vsplit| command (\xref \vsplit),
it sets the values of these commands as follows:
\ulist\compact
\li |\splitfirstmark| contains the tokens of the first mark in 
the item list of $V$.
\li |\splitbotmark| contains the tokens of the last mark in
the item list of $V$.
\endulist
These commands produce no tokens if there was no preceding |\vsplit|,
or if the most recent preceding |\vsplit| didn't contain any marks.
