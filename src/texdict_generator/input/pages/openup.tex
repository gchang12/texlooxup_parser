\cts openup {\<dimen>}
\explain
This command increases ^|\baselineskip| by \<dimen>.
An |\openup| command before the end of a paragraph affects
the entire paragraph, so you shouldn't use |\openup| to
change |\baseline!-skip| within a paragraph.  |\openup| is
most useful for typesetting tables and math displays---a
little extra space between rows often makes them more readable.
^^{alignments//space between rows of}
\example
Alice picked up the White King very gently, and lifted him 
across more slowly than she had lifted the Queen; but before
she put him on the table, she thought she might well dust
him a little, he was so covered with ashes.
