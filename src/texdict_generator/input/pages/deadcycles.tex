\cts deadcycles {\param{number}}
\explain
This parameter contains the number of times that \TeX\ has initiated
the \minref{output routine} since the last time it did a
^^|\shipout| |\ship!-out|.\footnote{
More precisely, \TeX\ sets |\dead!-cyles| to $0$ whenever it executes
|\ship!-out|
and increments it by $1$ whenever it executes |\output|.}
If |\deadcycles| gets too big, you've probably gotten
\TeX\ into a loop, e.g., one where the page builder is trying the same page
break over and over again.
