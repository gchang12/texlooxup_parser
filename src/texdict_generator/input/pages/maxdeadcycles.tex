\cts maxdeadcycles {\param{number}}
\explain
If the value of |\deadcycles| exceeds the value of |\maxdeadcycles|,
\TeX\ assumes that the output routine has gotten into a loop.
\TeX\ then complains and runs its own simple output routine,
equivalent to |\shipout!allowbreak\box255|, 
that is likely to break the loop.
\PlainTeX\ sets |\maxdeadcycles| \hbox{to $25$}.
