\explain
If this parameter is greater than $0$ when \TeX\ 
is processing a page break, \TeX\ will refrain from processing insertions.
Setting this parameter to $1$
can be useful when you're writing an output routine
that needs to reprocess the contents of the page, e.g.,
an output routine that uses a value of |\vsize| (\xref \vsize) different from
the one used by the page builder.
