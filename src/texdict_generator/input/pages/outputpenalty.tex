\cts outputpenalty {\param{number}}
\explain
\TeX\ sets this parameter when it breaks a page.  If the breakpoint was at a
\minref{penalty} item, \TeX\ removes the penalty item and
sets |\outputpenalty| to the penalty value at
the breakpoint; otherwise it sets |\outputpenalty| \hbox{to $0$}.

Suppose that you are undoing a page break
in order to break the page at a different place than the one that \TeX\
has just chosen.  In order to reconstruct the page, you need to recreate
the penalty at \TeX's chosen breakpoint.
You can accomplish this with the command
|\penalty!allowbreak\outputpenalty|.
