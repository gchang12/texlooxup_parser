\explain
This command instructs \TeX\ to send \<box> to the \dvifile.
^^{\dvifile//receives boxes from \b\tt\\shipout\e}
\TeX\ expands any |\write| command in \<box> as part of |\shipout|.
^^|\write//expanded during {\tt\\shipout}|
The principal use of |\shipout| is in the output routine, but you can
use it anywhere.
