\explain
This command provides a kind of conditional page break.
It tells \TeX\ to
break the page---but not if the text up to a later |\filbreak| also 
fits on the same page.
By enclosing a paragraph in a pair of |\filbreak|s,
you can ensure that \TeX\ will keep a paragraph on a single page if it can.
You should not use |\filbreak| within a paragraph, since it 
forces \TeX\ into vertical mode and thus ends the paragraph.
See \xrefpg{filbreak} for more advice on this subject.
