\explain
^^{dots}
This command produces an ^{ellipsis}, i.e., three dots, in ordinary text.
It's intended for use in mathematical writing; for an ellipsis 
between ordinary words, you should use |$\ldots$| \ctsref{\ldots} instead.
Since |\dots| includes its own space, you shouldn't follow it by 
|\!vs|.
\example
The sequence $x_1$, $x_2$, \dots, $x_\infty$
does not terminate.

\produces
The sequence $x_1$, $x_2$, \dots, $x_\infty$
does not terminate.
