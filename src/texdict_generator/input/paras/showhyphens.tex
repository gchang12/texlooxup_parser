\explain
This command isn't normally used in documents, but you can use it at
your terminal to see how \TeX\ would hyphenate some random set of words.
The words, with hyphenations indicated, appear both in the log and at
your terminal.  You'll get a complaint about an underfull hbox---just
ignore it.
