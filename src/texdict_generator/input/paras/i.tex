\explain
These commands produce dotless versions of the letters `i' and `j'.
You should use them instead of the ordinary `i' and `j' when you are putting
an accent above those letters in ordinary text.
^^{dotless letters}
Use the ^|\imath| and ^|\jmath| commands (\xref\imath)
for dotless `i's and `j's in math formulas.
\example
long `i' as in l\=\i fe  \quad \v\j
|
\produces
long `i' as in l\=\i fe  \quad \v\j
