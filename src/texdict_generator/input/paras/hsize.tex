\bix^^{line breaks//and paragraph shape}
\easy\cts hsize {\param{dimen}}
\explain
This \minref{parameter} specifies the current ^{line length},
i.e., the usual width of lines in a paragraph
starting at the left margin.
A great many \TeX\ commands, e.g., |\centerline| (\xref{\centerline})
and |\hrule| (\xref{\hrule}), implicitly use the value of
|\hsize|.  By changing |\hsize| within a group
you can change the width of the constructs produced by such commands.

If you 
set |\hsize| within a \minref{vbox} that contains text, the vbox will
have whatever width you've given to |\hsize|.
^^{vboxes//width determined by \b\tt\\hsize\e}

\PlainTeX\ sets |\hsize| to |6.5in|.

\example
{\hsize = 3.5in % Set this paragraph 3.5 inches wide.
The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,
which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for
croqueting one of them with the other.\par}%
|
\produces
{\hsize = 3.5in 
The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,
which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting
one of them with the other.\par}%
