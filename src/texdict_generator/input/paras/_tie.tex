\explain
The \minref{active character} `|~|', called a ``^{tie}'', 
produces a normal interword space
between two words and links those words so that
a line break will not occur between them.
You should use a tie in any context where a line break would be confusing,
e.g., before a middle initial, after an abbreviation such as ``Dr.'',
or after ``Fig.'' in ``Fig.~8''.

\example
P.D.Q.~Bach (1807--1742), the youngest and most
imitative son of Johann~S. Bach, composed the
{\sl Concerto for Horn and Hardart}.
