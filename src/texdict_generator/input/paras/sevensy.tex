\explain
These commands cause \TeX\ to typeset the following text in the
specified font.  Normally you would enclose 
one of these font-selecting commands in a
group, together with the text to be set in the selected font.
Outside of a group a font-selecting command is
effective until the end of the document
(unless you override it with another such command). 
\example
See how I've reduced my weight---from
120 lbs.\ to {\sevenrm 140 lbs}.
