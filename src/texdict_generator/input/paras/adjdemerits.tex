\explain
\minrefs{line break}
^^{hyphenation//penalties for}
{\tighten
This parameter specifies additional \minref{demerits} that \TeX\ attaches to a
breakpoint between two adjacent lines that are
``visually incompatible''.  
Such a pair of lines makes a paragraph appear uneven.
Incompatibility is evaluated in terms of the tightness or looseness
of lines:
}
\olist\compact
\li A line is tight if its \minref{glue} needs to shrink by at least $50\%$.
\li A line is decent if its badness is $12$ or less.
\li A line is loose if its glue needs to stretch by more than $50\%$.
\li A line is very loose if its glue needs to stretch so much
that its badness exceeds $100$.
\endolist
Two adjacent lines are visually incompatible
if their categories are not adjacent, e.g., a tight line is next to a loose one
or a decent line is next to a very loose one.

Demerits are in units of \minref{badness} squared, so 
you need to assign a rather large value to this parameter (in the 
thousands) for it to have any effect.
\PlainTeX\ sets |\adjdemerits| to~$10000$.
