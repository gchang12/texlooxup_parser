\explain
The |\-| command inserts a ``discretionary hyphen''
^^{discretionary hyphens}
into a word.
The discretionary hyphen allows \TeX\ to hyphenate the word at that
place.  \TeX\ isn't obliged to hyphenate there---it does so
only if it needs to.  This command is useful when a word 
that occurs in one or two places in your document
needs to be hyphenated,
but \TeX\ can't find an appropriate hyphenation point on its own.
\example
Alice was exceedingly reluctant to shake hands first
with either Twee\-dle\-dum or Twee\-dle\-dee, for
fear of hurting the other one's feelings.

\produces
