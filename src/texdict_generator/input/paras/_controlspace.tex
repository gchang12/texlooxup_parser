\easy\ctsbasic {\\\vs}{}
\blankidxref\ctsxrdef{@space}
\explain
This command explicitly produces an interword
space called a ``^{control space}''.
A control space is useful when a
letter occurs immediately after a control sequence, or in any other
circumstance where you don't want two tokens to be run together in the
output.
The amount of space produced by |\!vs|
is independent of preceding punctuation, i.e., its space factor
(\xref\spacefactor) is $1000$.

Incidentally, if you want to print the `\vs' ^^{visible space}
character that we've used here to denote a space, you can get it by typing
|{\tt \char `\ }|.
