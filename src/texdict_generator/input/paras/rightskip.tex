\explain
These parameters tell \TeX\ how much glue to place
at the left and at the right end of each line of the current
paragraph.  We'll just explain how |\leftskip| works since |\rightskip| 
is analogous.

^^{indentation} You can increase the left margin by setting |\leftskip|
to a fixed nonzero \minref{dimension}.  If you give |\leftskip| some
stretch, you can produce ^{ragged left} text, i.e.,
text that has an uneven left margin.

Ordinarily, you should enclose any \minref{assignment} to |\leftskip|
in a \minref{group} together with the affected text
in order to keep its effect from continuing to
the end of your document.  However, it's pointless to change
|\leftskip|'s value inside a group that is in turn
contained within a paragraph---the value of |\leftskip| at the
\emph{end} of a paragraph
is what determines how \TeX\ breaks the paragraph into lines.  \minrefs{line
break}
