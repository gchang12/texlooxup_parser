\cts hglue {\<glue>}
\cts vglue {\<glue>}
^^{vertical glue}
^^{horizontal glue}
\explain
The |\hglue| command produces horizontal \minref{glue} that won't disappear at
a line break; the |\vglue| command
produces vertical \minref{glue} that won't disappear at a page break. 
In other respects these commands are just like |\hskip| and |\vskip|.
You can use |\vglue| to produce blank space at the top of a page,
e.g., above a title on the first page of a document, but
^|\topglue| (next) is usually better for this purpose.
