\cts phantom {\<argument>}
\explain
\bix^^{boxes//phantom}
\bix^^{phantoms}
This command produces an empty \minref{box}
having the same size and placement
that \<argument> would have were it typeset.  
One use of |\phantom| is for reserving space for a symbol that for some
reason needs to be drawn in by hand.
\example
$1\phantom{9}2$

\produces
$1\phantom{9}2$
