\cts vbadness {\param{number}}
\explain
These parameters specify the thresholds of horizontal and vertical
\minref{badness} for reporting underfull or overfull boxes.
|\hbadness| applies to hboxes and |\vbadness| applies to vboxes.
If the badness of a constructed box exceeds the threshold,
\TeX\ will report an error.  If you raise the thresholds
(the \plainTeX\ defaults are both $1000$),
\TeX\ will be less likely to complain.
Note that the settings of |\hbadness| and |\vbadness| have no effect on
the appearance of your typeset document; they only affect the error
messages that you get.
See \knuth{page~302} for a precise description
of how \TeX\ decides when to complain about an overfull or underfull
box.

\hbadness = 10000 % Suppress any hbadness complaints.

\hbadness = 500 % Report hbadness exceeding 500.
