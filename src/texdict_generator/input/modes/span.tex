\cts span {}
\explain
The meaning of this command depends on whether it appears in a preamble
or in an alignment entry.
\ulist
\li Normally, \TeX\ does not expand tokens in the preamble
when it reads them.
Putting |\span| in front of a token in the preamble causes
that token to be expanded immediately according to \TeX's usual rules
of \minref{macro} expansion.
\li Putting |\span| instead of `|&|' between two column or row entries
causes those columns or rows to be combined.
For a horizontal alignment,
the width of the combined column is the sum of the
widths of the component columns.
For a vertical alignment,
the height of the combined row is the sum of the
heights of the component rows.
The template of the combined column or combined row forms a single group,
so font-setting commands preceding a |\span| affect everything up to
the next `|&|'.
\endulist
\noindent
|\span| is rarely useful by itself outside of a template,
but it provides the basic mechanism
for defining ^|\multispan|.
