\explain
This command produces a \minref{kern} whose width is one ^{en}
(half of an em, see \xrefpg{dimdefs}).
\TeX\ won't break a line
at an |\enspace| unless it's followed by glue.
In a bulleted list, the bullets are usually separated from the following
text by an |\enspace|.
\example
Lemma 1.\enspace There exists a white rabbit.

\produces
