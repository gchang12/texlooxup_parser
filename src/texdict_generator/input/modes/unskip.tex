\explain
If the last item on the current list is of type \minref{kern},
\minref{glue}, or \minref{penalty} respectively, these commands remove it
from that list.  If the item isn't of the right type, these commands have
no effect.  Like ^|\lastbox|, you can't apply them to lists in math mode or to
the main vertical list.
These commands
are most useful after a macro call that is known to have inserted
a specific item that you don't want there.
\TeX\ doesn't provide an ^|\unbox| command because |\lastbox| produces
nearly the same effect.
