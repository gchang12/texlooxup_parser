\concept class

The \defterm{class} of a \refterm{character} specifies that character's
role in math formulas.  The class of a character is encoded in its
\refterm{mathcode}.  ^^{mathcodes//class encoded in} For example, the
equals sign `|=|' has class $3$ (Relation).  \TeX\ uses its knowledge
of character classes to decide how much space to put between different
components of a math formula.  \margin{clarifying material added} For
example, here's a math formula shown first as \TeX\ normally prints it
and then with the class of each character randomly changed:
$$\strut a+(b-a)=a \qquad
   \mathopen{a}\mathord{+}\mathrel{(}\mathclose{b}\mathclose{-}
   \mathop{a}\mathopen{)}\mathord{=}\mathopen{a}$$

See \xrefpg\mathord\ of this book for a list of the classes and
\knuth{page~154} for their meanings.
