^^{vertical lists//vboxes formed from}
A \defterm{vbox} (vertical box) is a \refterm{box} that \TeX\ constructs
by placing the items of a \refterm{vertical list} one after another, top
to bottom.  A vbox, taken as a unit, is neither inherently horizontal
nor inherently vertical, i.e., it can appear as an item of either a
vertical list or a \refterm{horizontal list}.  You can construct a vbox
with the ^|\vbox| or the ^|\vtop| command
\ctsref{\vtop}.  The difference is that for |\vbox|,
the \refterm{reference point}
of the constructed vbox is derived from that of the last (and
usually bottommost) constituent list item, but for |\vtop|, it's that of the
first (and usually topmost) constituent list item.
