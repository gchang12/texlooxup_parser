\concept token

A \defterm{token} is either a single character tagged with a
\refterm{category code}, or a \refterm{control sequence}.  \TeX\ reads
characters from a file using its eyes \seeconcept{\anatomy}
and groups the characters into tokens using its mouth.  When a token
reaches \TeX's stomach, \TeX\ interprets it as a \refterm{command}
unless it's part of an argument of a preceding command.
