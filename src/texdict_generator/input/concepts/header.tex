\concept header

A \defterm{header} is material that \TeX\ puts at the top of every page,
above the text of that page.
The header for a simple report
might consist of the title on the left side of
the page and the text ``Page $n$'' on the right side of the page.
Ordinarily a header consists of a single line, which you can set by
assigning a token list to ^|\headline| \ctsref\headline.
The default \plainTeX\ header is blank.
It's possible to produce multiline headers too; see \xrefpg{bighead} for
how to do it.
