\concept {file name}

A \defterm{file name} names a 
\refterm{file} that is known to the ^{operating system}
that in turn
supervises your \TeX\ run.  The syntax of a file name does \emph{not}
follow the usual rules of \TeX\ syntax, and in fact it is different
in different implementations of \TeX.
In particular, most \TeX\ implementations consider a file name to be
terminated by a blank or an end of line.  Thus \TeX\ is likely to
misinterpret `|{\input chapter2}|' 
by taking the right brace as part of the file name.
As a general rule, you should follow a file name by a blank or the
end of the line as in `|{\input chapter2!visiblespace}|'.
