\concept math mode

{\tighten
A \defterm{math mode} is a \refterm{mode} that \TeX\ is in when it is
building a math formula.  \TeX\ has two different math modes: ^{text
math mode} for building a formula to be embedded within a line of text,
and ^{display math mode} for building a formula to appear on a line by
itself.  You indicate text math mode by enclosing the formula in
|$|'s, and display math mode by enclosing the formula in
|$$|'s.
%\TeX\ will accept most \refterm{commands:command} in
%math mode. If it encounters a command in math mode that doesn't make
%sense in a formula, it will complain.
An important property of both
math modes is that \emph{input spaces don't count}.  See
\knuth{pages~290--293} for details on how \TeX\ responds to different
commands in math mode.
