\concept penalty

A \defterm{penalty} is an item that you can include in a 
horizontal, vertical, or math list
in order to discourage \TeX\ from breaking the list
at that point or encourage \TeX\ to break the list there.  
^^{horizontal lists//penalties in}
^^{vertical lists//penalties in}
A positive penalty indicates a bad break point, while
a negative penalty indicates a good break point.
Breaking an
ordinary horizontal
list produces a \refterm{line break}, while breaking an
ordinary vertical list produces
a \refterm{page break}.  
(A penalty has no effect in restricted horizontal or 
internal vertical \refterm{mode}.)

You can use the
|\penalty| command (\pp\xrefn{hpenalty},~\xrefn{vpenalty})
to insert a penalty explicitly.
A penalty of $10000$ or more prevents a break, while a penalty of
$-10000$  or less forces a break.
