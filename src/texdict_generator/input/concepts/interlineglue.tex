\concept {interline glue}

\defterm{Interline glue} is the glue that \TeX\ inserts in front of every
\refterm{box} in a \refterm{vertical list} except for the first one.
The interline glue is ordinarily specified so as to maintain a constant
distance between the baselines of the boxes.  
Its value is jointly determined by the ^|\baselineskip|,
^|\lineskip|, and ^|\lineskiplimit| parameters \ctsref{\baselineskip}.
