\concept footer

A \defterm{footer} is material that \TeX\ puts at the bottom of every page,
below the text of that page.
The default footer in \plainTeX\ is a centered page number.
Ordinarily a footer consists of a single line, which you can set by
assigning a token list to ^|\footline| \ctsref\footline.
See \xrefpg{bighead} for a method of producing multiline footers.
