\concept demerits

\TeX\ uses \refterm{demerits} as a measure of how undesirable a line is
when it's breaking a paragraph into lines \seeconcept{line break}.
^^{line breaks//demerits for}
The demerits of a line are affected both by the \refterm{badness} of the line
and by \refterm{penalties:penalty} associated with the line.
^^{badness}
\TeX's goal in choosing a particular arrangement of lines is to minimize the
total demerits for the paragraph, which it computes by adding up the demerits
for the individual lines.
See \knuth{pages~97--98} for the details of how \TeX\
breaks a paragraph into lines.  
\TeX\ does not use demerits when it's choosing page breaks; instead, it uses
a similar measure known as the ``cost'' of a particular page break.
