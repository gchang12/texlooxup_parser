\explain
{\emergencystretch=1em
This command tests if \<token$_1$> and \<token$_2$>
have the same \minref{character} code, independent of their
\minref{category code}s.
Before performing the test, \TeX\ expands tokens following the |\if|
until it obtains two tokens that can't be expanded further.  
These two tokens become \<token$_1$> and \<token$_2$>.
The expansion
includes replacing  a control sequence |\let| equal to a character token
by that character token.
A \minref{control sequence} that can't be further expanded is
considered to have character code $256$.\par}
\example
\def\first{abc}
\if\first true\else false\fi;
% ``c'' is left over from the expansion of \first.
% It lands in the unexecuted ``true'' part.
\if a\first\ true\else false\fi;
% Here ``bc'' is left over from the expansion of \first
\if \hbox\relax true\else false\fi
% Unexpandable control sequences test equal with ``if''
