\explain
This command is used as a prefix to a \minref{macro} definition.
It tells \TeX\ that the arguments to the macro are permitted to include
|\par| tokens (\xref{\@par}), which normally indicate the end of a paragraph.
^^|\par//in macro arguments|
If \TeX\
tries to expand a macro defined without |\long| and any of
the macro's arguments include a |\par| token,
\TeX\ will complain about a runaway argument.  The purpose
of this behavior is to provide you with some protection against unterminated
macro arguments.
|\long| gives you a way of bypassing the protection.
\example
\long\def\aa#1{\par\hrule\smallskip#1\par\smallskip\hrule}
\aa{This is the first line.\par
This is the second line.}
% without \long, TeX would complain
