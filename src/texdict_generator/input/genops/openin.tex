\cts openin {\<number> {\bt =} \<filename>}
\explain
This command tells \TeX\ to open the file named \<filename>
and make it available for reading  via the input stream
designated by \<number>.
^^{input streams//opening}
\<number> must be between $0$ and $15$.
Once you've opened a file and connected it to an input stream,
you can read from the file using the |\read| command
with the input stream's number.  

You can associate more than one input stream with the same
file.  You can then read from several different positions within
the file, one for each input stream.

You should allocate |\openin| stream numbers with
|\newread| (\xref{\@newread}).
\example
\newread\auxfile  \openin\auxfile = addenda.aux
% \auxfile now denotes the number of this opening
% of addenda.aux.
