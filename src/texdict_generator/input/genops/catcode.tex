^^{category codes//in \b\tt\\catcode\e\ table}
This table entry contains the \minref{category code} of the character
whose \ascii\ code is \<charcode>.
The category codes are listed on \xrefpg{catcodes}.
By changing the category code of a character you can get \TeX\ to treat
that character differently.
\example
\catcode `\[ = 1 \catcode `\] = 2
% Make [ and ] act like left and right braces.
