\cts tracingrestores {\param{number}}
\explain
If this parameter is greater than zero,
\TeX\ will record in the log file
the values that it restores when it encounters the end of a \minref{group}.
If ^|\tracingonline| is greater than zero, this information will also appear
at your terminal.

Some production forms of \TeX\ ignore the value of |\tracing!-restores|
so that they can run faster.
If you need to use this parameter, be sure to use a form that
responds to it.
