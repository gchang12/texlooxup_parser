\explain
If this parameter is greater than zero,
\TeX\ will record in the log file its calculations of the cost of
various line breaks that it tries.
^^{line breaking//tracing}
If ^|\tracingonline| is greater than zero, this information will also appear
at your terminal.
\TeX\  produces this output when it reaches the end of each paragraph.
See \knuth{pages~98--99} for an illustration and explanation of
this output.

Some production forms of \TeX\ ignore the value of |\tracing!-para!-graphs|
so that they can run faster.
If you need to use this parameter, be sure to use a form that
responds to it.
