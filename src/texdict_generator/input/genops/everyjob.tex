\cts everyjob {\param{token list}}
\explain
This parameter contains a \minref{token} list that \TeX\ expands at the
start of every job.  Because an assignment to |\everyjob| cannot affect
the current run (by the time you've done the assignment it's already too
late), it is only useful to people who are preparing format files.
