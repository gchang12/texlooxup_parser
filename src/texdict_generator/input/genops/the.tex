\cts the {\<token>}
\explain
This command generally expands to a list of \minref{character} tokens
that represents \<token>.  \<token> can be any of the following:

\ulist\compact
\li a \TeX\ \minref{parameter}, e.g., |\parindent| or |\deadcycles|
^^{parameters//using \b\tt\\the\e\ with}
\li a \minref{register}, e.g., |\count0|
^^{registers//with \b\tt\\the\e}
\margin{Item for special registers removed}
\li a code associated with an input character, e.g., |\catcode`(|
\li a font parameter, e.g., |\fontdimen3\sevenbf|
\li the ^|\hyphenchar| or ^|\skewchar| of a font, e.g., 
|\skewchar\teni|
\li ^|\lastpenalty|, ^|\lastskip|, or ^|\lastkern| (values derived from
the last item on the current horizontal \minrefs{horizontal list}
or \minref{vertical list})
\li a control sequence defined by ^|\chardef| or
^|\mathchardef|
\endulist

\noindent
In addition, |\the| can expand to noncharacter tokens in the following two
cases: 
\ulist\compact
\li |\the| \<font>, which expands to the most recently defined
control sequence that selects
the same font as the control sequence \<font>
\li |\the| \<token variable>, which expands to a copy of the value of the
variable, e.g., |\the\everypar|
\endulist

See \knuth{pages~214--215} for a more detailed description of what
|\the| does in various cases.
\example
The vertical size is currently \the\vsize.
The category code of `(' is \the\catcode `(.

\produces
The vertical size is currently \the\vsize.
