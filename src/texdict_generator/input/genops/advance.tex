\cts advance {\<count register> {\bt by} \<number>}
\aux\cts advance {\<dimen register> {\bt by} \<dimen>}
\aux\cts advance {\<skip register> {\bt by} \<glue>}
\aux\cts advance {\<muskip register> {\bt by} \<muglue>}
\explain
This command adds a compatible quantity to a register.  For \<glue>
or \<muglue> all three components (natural value, stretch, and shrink)
\minrefs{glue} are added.
Any of the quantities can be negative.  For purposes of these calculations
(and other assignments as well), \<glue> can be converted to a
\<dimen> by dropping the stretch and shrink, and a \<dimen> can be converted
to a \<number> by taking its value in scaled points 
\seeconcept{dimension}.
You can omit the word |by| in these commands---\TeX\ will understand them
anyway.
\example
\count0 = 18 \advance\count0 by -1 \number\count0\par
\skip0 = .5in \advance\skip0 by 0in plus 1in % add stretch
\hbox to 2in{a\hskip\skip0 b}
