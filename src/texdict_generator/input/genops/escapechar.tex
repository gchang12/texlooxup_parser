\cts escapechar {\param{number}}
\explain
This parameter specifies the \ascii\ code \minrefs{\ascii} of the
character that \TeX\ uses to represent the \minref{escape character}
^^{escape character//represented by \b\tt\\escapechar\e}
when it's
converting a control sequence name to a sequence of character tokens.
This conversion occurs when you use the |\string| command and also when
\TeX\ is producing diagnostic messages.  The default value of the escape
character is $92$, the {\ascii} character code for a ^{backslash}.
If |\escapechar| is not in the range $0$--$255$,
\TeX\ does not include an escape character in the result of the conversion.
\example
\escapechar = `!!
the control sequence {\tt \string\bigbreak}
|
\produces
\escapechar = `!
the control sequence {\tt \string\bigbreak}
