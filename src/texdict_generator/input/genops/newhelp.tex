\explain
This command assigns the ^{help message} given by \<help text> to 
\<control sequence>.  It provides an efficient way of defining
the ^{help text} that further explains an error message.
Before issuing the error message with the |\errmessage| command,
you should assign \<control sequence> to ^|\errhelp|.  The help text
will then appear if the user types `|H|' 
or `|h|' in response to the error message.
\example
\newhelp\pain{Your input includes a token that I find^^J
   to be offensive. Don't bother me again with this^^J
   document until you've removed it.}
\errhelp = \pain \newlinechar = `\^^J
% ^^J will start a new line
