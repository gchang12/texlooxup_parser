\explain
^^{displays//actions for every display}
These parameters specify \minref{token} lists that \TeX\ inserts
at the start of every text math or display math formula, respectively.
You can
take special actions at the start of each math formula by
assigning those actions to |\everymath| or
|\everydisplay|.  Don't forget that if you want both kinds of formulas to
be affected, you need to set \emph{both} parameters.
\example
\everydisplay={\heartsuit\quad}
\everymath = {\clubsuit}
$3$ is greater than $2$ for large values of $3$.
$$4>3$$
|
\produces
\everydisplay={\heartsuit\quad}
\everymath = {\clubsuit}
$3$ is greater than $2$ for large values of $3$.
$$4>3$$
