\explain
Each of these three commands produces a ^{matrix}.  
The elements of each row of the input matrix
are separated by `|&|' and each row in turn is ended
by |\cr|.
(This is the same form that is used for an
\minref{alignment}.)
The commands differ in the following ways:
\ulist\compact
\li |\matrix| produces a matrix without any surrounding or inserted
\minref{delimiter}s.
\li |\pmatrix| produces a matrix surrounded by parentheses.
\li |\bordermatrix| produces a matrix in which the first row and the first
column are treated as labels.  (The first element of the first row is
usually left blank.)  The rest of the matrix is enclosed in
parentheses.
\endulist
\TeX\ can make the parentheses for |\pmatrix| and |\bordermatrix| as large as
they need to be by inserting vertical extensions.  If you want a matrix
to be surrounded by delimiters other than parentheses, you should use
|\matrix| in conjunction with |\left| and |\right| (\xref \left).

\example
$$\displaylines{
   \matrix{t_{11}&t_{12}&t_{13}\cr
           t_{21}&t_{22}&t_{23}\cr
           t_{31}&t_{32}&t_{33}\cr}\qquad
\left\{\matrix{t_{11}&t_{12}&t_{13}\cr
           t_{21}&t_{22}&t_{23}\cr
           t_{31}&t_{32}&t_{33}\cr}\right\}\cr
\pmatrix{t_{11}&t_{12}&t_{13}\cr
           t_{21}&t_{22}&t_{23}\cr
           t_{31}&t_{32}&t_{33}\cr}\qquad
\bordermatrix{&c_1&c_2&c_3\cr
           r_1&t_{11}&t_{12}&t_{13}\cr
           r_2&t_{21}&t_{22}&t_{23}\cr
           r_3&t_{31}&t_{32}&t_{33}\cr}\cr}$$
