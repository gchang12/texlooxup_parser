\cts mathsurround {\param{dimen}}
\explain
This parameter specifies the amount of space that \TeX\
inserts before and after a math formula in text mode (i.e., a formula
surrounded by single |$|'s).  See \knuth{page~162} for further details about
its behavior.
\PlainTeX\ leaves |\mathsurround| at |0pt|.
