\begindesc
\cts nonscript {}
\explain
When \TeX\ is currently typesetting in script or scriptscript
\minref{style} and encounters this command
immediately in front of glue or a kern,
it cancels the glue or kern.
|\nonscript| has no effect in the other styles.

This command provides a way of ``tightening up'' the spacing in
script and scriptscript styles, which generally are set in smaller type.
It is of little use outside of macro definitions.
