\cts limits {}
\explain
In text style, \TeX\ normally places limits after a large operator.
This command tells \TeX\ to place limits above and below a large
operator rather than after it.

If you specify more than one of |\limits|, |\nolimits|,
and |\display!-limits|, the last command rules.

\example
Suppose that $\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^Nq_i$ contains at least
two elements.

\produces
Suppose that $\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^Nq_i$ contains at least
two elements.
