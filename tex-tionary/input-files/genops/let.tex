^^{control sequences//defining with \b\tt\\let\e}
\minrefs{token}
This command causes
\<control sequence> to acquire the current meaning of \<token>.
Even if you redefine \<token> later, the meaning of \<control sequence>
will not change.  Although \<token> is most commonly a control sequence,
it can also be a \minref{character} token.
