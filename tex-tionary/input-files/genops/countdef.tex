\explain
These commands define \<control sequence> to refer to the
\minref{register} of the indicated category whose number is \<register>.
Normally you should use the commands in the previous group
(|\newcount|, etc.) in preference to these commands in order to avoid
numbering conflicts.  The commands in the previous group are
defined in terms of the commands \hbox{in this group}.
\example
\countdef\hatters = 19 % \hatters now refers to \count19
\toksdef\hares = 200 % \hares now refers to \toks200
