\cts string {\<control sequence>}
\explain
^^{control sequences//converting to strings}
This command produces
the characters that form the name of \<control sequence>,
including the \minref{escape character}.
The escape character is represented by the current value of
^|\escapechar|.
^^{escape character//represented by \b\tt\\escapechar\e}
\TeX\ gives the characters in the list a category code of $12$ (other).

You can perform the reverse operation with
the ^|\csname| command (\xref \csname),
which turns a string into a control sequence.
\example
the control sequence {\tt \string\bigbreak}
|
\produces
the control sequence {\tt \string\bigbreak}
