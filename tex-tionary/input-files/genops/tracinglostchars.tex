\cts tracinglostchars {\param{number}}
\explain
If this parameter is greater than zero,
\TeX\ will record an indication in the log file of each time
that it drops an output character because that character does not exist
in the current font.
If ^|\tracingonline| is greater than zero, this information will also appear
at your terminal.
\PlainTeX\ defaults it to $1$ (unlike the others).
\example
\tracinglostchars = 1
A {\nullfont few} characters.
