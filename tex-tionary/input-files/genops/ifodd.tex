^^{numbers//testing for odd/even}
This command tests if \<number> is odd.
Before performing the test, \TeX\ expands tokens following the |\ifodd|
until it obtains a sequence of tokens having the form \<number>,
followed by a token that can't be part of \<number>.
\example
\count255 = 19
\ifodd 5 true\else false\fi

\produces
