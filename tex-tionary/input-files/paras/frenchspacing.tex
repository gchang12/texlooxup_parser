^^{interword spacing}
\TeX\ normally adjusts the spacing between words to account for
punctuation marks.  For example, it inserts extra space at the end of a
sentence and adds some stretch to the \minref{glue} following any
punctuation mark there.  The |\frenchspacing| command tells \TeX\ to make
the interword spacing independent of punctuation, while the
|\nonfrenchspacing| command tells \TeX\ to use its normal spacing rules.
If you don't specify
|\frenchspacing|, you'll get \TeX's normal spacing.

See \xrefpg{periodspacing} for advice on how to control \TeX's treatment
of punctuation at the end of sentences.
