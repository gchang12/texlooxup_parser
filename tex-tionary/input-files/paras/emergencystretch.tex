\cts emergencystretch {\param{dimen}}
\explain
By setting this parameter to be greater than zero,
you can make it easier for \TeX\
to typeset your document without generating overfull hboxes.
^^{overfull boxes}
This is a better alternative than setting |\tolerance=10000|,
since that tends to produce really ugly lines.
If \TeX\ can't typeset a paragraph without exceeding ^|\tolerance|,
it will try again, adding |\emergencystretch| to the stretch of each
line.
The effect of the change is to scale down the badness of each
line, enabling \TeX\ to make spaces wider than they would otherwise be
and thus choose line breaks that are as
good as possible under the circumstances.
