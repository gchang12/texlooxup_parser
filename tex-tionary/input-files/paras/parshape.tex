\begindesc
\cts parshape {$n\; i_1 l_1\; i_2 l_2\; \ldots \;i_n l_n$}
\explain
This command specifies the shape of the first $n$ lines of a paragraph---
the next paragraph if you're in vertical mode and the current paragraph
if you're in horizontal mode.
The $i$'s and $l$'s are all
dimensions.  The first line is indented by $i_1$ and has length $l_1$,
the second line is indented by $i_2$ and has length $l_2$, and so forth.
If the paragraph has more than $n$ lines, the last indentation\slash
length pair is used for the extra lines.
To achieve special effects such as the one
shown here, you usually have to experiment a lot, insert kerns here and
there, and choose your words to fit the shape.

|\parshape|, like ^|\hangafter| and ^|\hangindent|, is effective only for one
paragraph.
If you specify |\hangafter| and |\hangindent| as well as |\par!-shape|,
\TeX\ ignores the ^|\hangafter| and ^|\hangindent|.

By the way, the following example saves and restores |\fontdimen| values
explicitly, using temporary registers, since |\fontdimen| changes are
always global (see \xref\fontdimen).

The wines of France and California may be the best known,
but they are not the only fine wines. Spanish wines are
often underestimated, and quite old ones may be available at
reasonable prices. For Spanish wines the vintage is not so
critical, but  the climate of the Bordeaux region varies
greatly from year to year. Some vintages are not as good as
others, so these years ought to be s\kern -.1pt p\kern -.1pt

vintages. Good luck finding them!!
