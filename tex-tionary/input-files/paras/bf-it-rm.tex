\explain
These commands select a type style without changing the typeface or
the point size.\footnote{
\TeX\ does not provide predefined commands for changing just the point
size, e.g., |\eightpoint|.
Supporting such commands would require a great number of fonts,
most of which would never be used.
Such commands were, however, used in typesetting \texbook.}
Normally you would enclose
one of these type style commands in a
group, together with the text to be set in the selected font.
Outside of a group a type style command is
effective until the end of the document
(unless you override it with another such command).
