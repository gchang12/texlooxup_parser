^^{overlapping text}
\cts llap {\<argument>}
\cts rlap {\<argument>}
\explain
These commands enable you to produce text that overlaps
whatever happens to be to the left or to the right of the current
position.  |\llap| backspaces by the width of \<argument> and then
typesets \<argument>.  |\rlap| is similar, except that it typesets
\<argument> first and then backspaces.  |\llap| and |\rlap| are useful for
placing text outside of the current margins.
Both |\llap| and |\rlap| do their work by creating
a \minref{box} of zero~width.

You can also use |\llap| or |\rlap| to construct special characters by
^{overprinting}, but don't try it unless you're sure that the characters
you're using have the same width (which is the case for a monospaced
font such as ^|cmtt10|, the Computer Modern $10$-point ^{typewriter font}).
