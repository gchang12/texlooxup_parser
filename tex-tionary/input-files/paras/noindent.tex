\explain
If \TeX\ is in vertical mode, as it is after ending a paragraph,
this command inserts the ^|\parskip| interparagraph glue,
puts \TeX\ into horizontal mode, and starts an unindented paragraph.
It has no effect in horizontal mode, i.e., within a paragraph.
Starting a paragraph with |\noindent| thus cancels
the indentation by |\parindent|
that would normally occur there.
^^{indentation}

A common use of |\noindent| is to cancel the indentation of
the first line of a
paragraph when the paragraph follows some displayed material.

\example
\parindent = 1em
Tied round the neck of the bottle was a label with the
words \smallskip \centerline{EAT ME}\smallskip
\noindent beautifully printed on it in large letters.
