\begindesc
\cts parindent {\param{dimen}}
\explain
This \minref{parameter} specifies the amount by which
the first line of each paragraph is to be indented. ^^{indentation}
As the example below shows, it's a bad idea to set both |\parindent|
and ^|\parskip| to zero since then the paragraph breaks are
no longer apparent.
\example
\parindent = 2em This paragraph is indented by 2 ems.
\par \parindent=0pt This paragraph is not indented at all.
\par Since we haven't reset the paragraph indentation,
this paragraph isn't indented either.
|
\produces
\parindent = 2em This paragraph is indented by 2 ems.
\par \parindent=0pt This paragraph is not indented at all.
\par Since we haven't reset the paragraph indentation,
this paragraph isn't indented either.
