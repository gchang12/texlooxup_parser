\explain
These commands produce various letters and ligatures from European
alphabets.
They are useful for occasional words and phrases in these
languages---but if you need to typeset a large amount of text in a European
language, you should probably be using a version of \TeX\ adapted
to that language.\footnote{The \TeX\ Users Group (\xref{resources}) can
provide you with information about European language versions of \TeX.}

You'll need a space after these commands when you use them within a word,
so that
\TeX\ will treat the following letters as part of the word
rather than as part of the command.
You needn't be in \minref{math mode} to use these commands.
