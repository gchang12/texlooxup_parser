\ctspecial penalty {\<number>} \xrdef{hpenalty}
\explain
This command produces a \minref{penalty} item.
The penalty item makes \TeX\ more or less willing to break a line
at the point where that item occurs.
A negative penalty, i.e., a bonus, encourages a line break;
a positive penalty discourages a line break.
A penalty of $10000$ or more prevents a break altogether,
while a penalty of $-10000$ or less forces a break.
|\penalty| can also be used in vertical mode.
