\begindesc
\cts interlinepenalty {\param{number}}
\explain
This parameter specifies the \minref{penalty} for
breaking a page between the lines of a paragraph.
By setting it to $10000$ you can force all page breaks to occur
between paragraphs, provided that the pages have enough stretch so
that \TeX\ can still compose them decently.
\PlainTeX\ leaves |\inter!-linepenalty| at~$0$.
