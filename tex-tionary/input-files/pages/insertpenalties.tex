\explain
\bix^^{insertions//penalties for}
\bix^^{floating material}
This parameter contains the sum of certain penalties \minrefs{penalty}
that \TeX\ accumulates as it is placing insertions onto the
current page.
These penalties are incurred when \TeX\ is processing an |\insert|
command
and discovers that a previous insertion  of the same kind on this page has
been split, leaving part of it for subsequent pages.
See \knuth{pages~123--125} for the details of this
calculation.

\margin{Material moved from a footnote to the main text.}
|\insertpenalties| has an entirely different meaning during an
^^{output routine//meaning of \b\tt\\insertpenalties\e\ in}
output routine---it's the number of insertions that have been seen
but that don't fit on the current page (see \knuth{page~125}).
