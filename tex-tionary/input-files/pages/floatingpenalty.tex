\cts floatingpenalty {\param{number}}
\explain
This parameter specifies the \minref{penalty} that
\TeX\ adds to |\insertpenalties|
^^|\insertpenalties|
when the page builder is adding an insertion to the current page
and discovers that a previous insertion  of the same kind on this page has
been split, leaving part of it for subsequent pages.
\PlainTeX\ leaves |\floatingpenalty| at~$0$.
