\cts pagegoal {\param{dimen}}
\explain
This parameter specifies the
desired height for the current page.
\TeX\  sets
|\pagegoal| to the current value of |\vsize|
when it first puts a box or an insertion on the current page.
You can shorten a page while \TeX\ is working on it by
changing the value of |\pagegoal|---even if the new value is
less than the height of the material already on that page.
\TeX\ will just put the extra material on the next page.
But remember---|\pagegoal| is reset to |\vsize| again when \TeX\
starts the next page.
