\explain
These commands expand to the mark text in an item generated by an earlier
^|\mark| command.
The mark text has the form of a token list.
\TeX\ sets the values of these commands when it
finishes placing the contents of a page into ^|\box255|,
just before calling the \minref{output routine}
as part of its \minref{page break}ing actions.  \TeX\ determines
these values as follows:
\ulist\compact
\li |\firstmark| contains the tokens of the first mark on the page.
\li |\botmark| contains the tokens of the last mark on the page.
\li |\topmark| contains the tokens of the mark that is in effect at
the very top of the page.
That mark is the last mark
that \emph{preceded} the page,
i.e., the |\botmark| of the previous page.
It is empty if no marks preceded the page.
\endulist
\noindent
If a page has no marks on it, \TeX\ will set |\firstmark| and |\botmark| to
the same mark as |\topmark|, i.e., the most recent preceding mark.
The table at the bottom of \knuth{page~258} illustrates the relation among
|\firstmark|, |\botmark|, and |\topmark|.
