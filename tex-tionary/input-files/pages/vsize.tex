\cts vsize {\param{dimen}}
\explain
This parameter specifies the current vertical extent of a page.
\TeX\ examines it only when it is starting a page.  Thus if you change
|\vsize| in the
middle of a page, your change won't affect anything until the following page.
If you want to change the vertical extent of a page when
you're in the middle of it, you  should assign the new
height to ^|\pagegoal| (\xref \pagegoal) instead.  (If you
want the change to affect the following pages too, you should
change \emph{both} |\vsize| and |\pagegoal|.)
\PlainTeX\ sets |\vsize| to |8.9in|.
