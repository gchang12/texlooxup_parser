\explain
These commands produce the list contained in box register \<register> and
leave the contents of the register undisturbed.
|\unhcopy| applies to box registers containing hboxes
and |\unvcopy| applies to box registers containing vboxes.
\example
\setbox0=\hbox{The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and
drew the back of one flapper across his eyes. }
\setbox1=\hbox{He tried to speak, but sobs choked his
voice. }
\unhcopy0 \unhcopy1\par\noindent
% \box0 \box1 would set two hboxes side by side
% (and produce a badly overfull line).
\box1 % Produces an hbox (which can't be broken).
