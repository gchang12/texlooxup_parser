\explain
This command
produces a negative kern whose width is one-sixth of an em
(\xref{dimdefs}),
i.e., it causes \TeX\ to move its position left by that amount.
It is useful for bringing together characters that are a little too
far apart.
\TeX\ won't break a line at a |\negthinspace|.\minrefs{line break}
\example
The horror, the horror\negthinspace, the horror of it all!!
