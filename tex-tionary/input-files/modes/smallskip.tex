\bix^^{vertical space}
\easy\cts smallskip {}
\cts medskip {}
\cts bigskip {}
\explain
These commands produce successively larger
amounts of vertical space:
\display{{\def\bar{\kern 2pt\hrule width 5pc}
\def\lbl#1{\hbox to 5pc{\hfil #1skip\hfil}}
\leavevmode
\vtop{\lbl{small}\bar\smallskip\bar}\quad
\vtop{\lbl{med}\bar\medskip\bar}\quad\vtop{\lbl{big}\bar\bigskip\bar}}}
\noindent
|\smallskip| skips by $3$ points and can stretch or
shrink by $1$ point.  |\med!-skip| is equivalent to two |\smallskip|s
and |\bigskip| is equivalent to two |\medskip|s.

These commands end a paragraph since they are inherently vertical.
The skips that they produce
are in addition to the normal interparagraph skip.
\example
Hop \smallskip skip \medskip and \bigskip jump.

\produces
