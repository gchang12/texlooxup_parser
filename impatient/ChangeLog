	* book.sdx (\unorderedlist): correct name from \unnumberedlist
	index entry. Manually edited generated index file here.
	(PDF p.388 = printed p.368)

	* concepts.tex (class): has class, not is in class. (PDF p.76 =
	printed p.56)

	* concepts.tex (category code, character): reword to reduce
	confusion of (say) character code 65 with
	typesetting a letter A.
	Also, it's not plain tex that defines what the catcodes are.
	Lots more could be done. (PDF pp.74-75 = printed pp.54-55)

	* concepts.tex (category code): explicit kern to avoid $c$grok
	without space. (PDF p.73 = printed p.53)

	* xmptext.tex (A ruled table): fl would be a ligature.
	* xmptext.tex (A ruled table): reword \vtop comment.
	(PDF p.57 = printed p.37)

	* usingtex.tex (Math formulas): mention that \TeX\ does its own
	spacing math. (PDF p.36 = printed p.16)

	* usingtex.tex (Spaces): supposed to produce -> supposed to
	do. (PDF p.32 = printed p.12)

	* usebook.tex: mention that chapter (section) 13 is also random access.
	(PDF p.21 = printed p.1)

	* genops.tex: avoid horrible language list that's now in
	\fmtversion, running off the page. (PDF p.245 = printed p.225)

	* usingtex.tex: force \eject to avoid underfull \vbox.
	(PDF p.34 = printed p.14)

	* macros.tex (\hand): the right-pointing hand is \char"2B in
	pzdr. Report from Will Adams.

	* xmptext.tex: "pages 97 and 100", using new \xrefndelim.
	(PDF p.46 = printed p.26)
	* macros.tex (\xrefndelim): new macro.

	Because we no longer have that erroneous extra stretchability from
	the \fontdimen example:

	* fdl.tex: use \spaceskip twice to avoid overfull boxes.

	* genops.tex (\showlists): reword to avoid overfull box.
	(PDF p.273 = printed p.253)

	* genops.tex: reword "stream numbers...\newread" sentence to
	avoid overfull box. (PDF p.268 = printed p.248)

	Following bugs reported recently by David Fuchs,
	and by others in the past:
	
	* paras.tex (\parshape): explicitly save and restore \fontdimen
	since those assignments are global. Mention this in description.
        (PDF pp.138-9 = printed pp.118-9)

	* genops.tex (Naming and reserving registers, etc.): reword first
	item to avoid the doubling of \fontdimen3, which is not grouped,
	thus affects all subsequent text (!). (PDF p.264 = printed p.244)
	
	(\fontdimen): show the save and restore of \fontdimen value
	in the example. (PDF p.243 = printed p.223)
	
	* paras.tex (\everypar): remove \vglue hack for \secondprinting
	to avoid overwriting text. A blank line before \example solves it
	well enough. (PDF p.133 = printed p.113)

	* errata.future: page 113 overlap now fixed; updates for all other
	changes as needed.

	* copyrght.tex: 2020

	* Start from CTAN release of 13 November 2014 (393 PDF pages).
	The version at https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/teximpatient has
	been moved to git, but, it seems, no substantive changes made.
