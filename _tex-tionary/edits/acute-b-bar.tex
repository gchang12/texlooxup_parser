\explain
These commands produce accent marks in math formulas.  You'll ordinarily
need to leave a space after any one of them.
A wide accent can be applied to a multicharacter subformula;
\TeX\ will center the accent over the subformula.
The other accents are usefully applied only to a single character.

\example
$\dot t^n \qquad \widetilde{v_1 + v_2}$
|
\produces
$\dot t^n \qquad \widetilde{v_1 + v_2}$

\cts mathaccent {\<mathcode>}
\explain
This command tells \TeX\ to typeset a math accent
whose family and character code are given by \<mathcode>.  (\TeX\ ignores
the class of the \minref{mathcode}.)
See \knuth{Appendix~G} for the details of how \TeX\ positions such an accent.
The usual way to use |\mathaccent| is to put it in a macro definition
that gives a name to a math accent.
\example
\def\acute{\mathaccent "7013}
